Core Concepts:-
	1-the system should be able to measure the pressure within crew cabin
	2-An alarm should be triggered when the pressure exceeds 20 bar
	3-an alarm should be active for 60sec
	4-the system should be able to store pressure in flash memory accompined by time stamps(optional)
Assumptions:-
	1-the sensor,alarm and MCU is assumed to have no risk of failure and have power source
	2-maintaince of the MCU arent withing the scope of this project

Method:-
	Waterfall Model
